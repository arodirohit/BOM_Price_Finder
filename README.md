### BOM_Price_Finder

1. This application returns/quotes the price of each product needed to make a PCB .
2. The application takes A BOM sheet as a input where the item/part number is specified. This specific columns are hard coded in the line 24.
3. All the required part number and quantity from multiple sheets are stored inside a list named slicedData
4. Create an URL for each of the partnumber and fetch the price from internet using Octopart API. The URL is unique for everone and the api key can by generated by creating an account in www.octopart.com. Once the API key is generated replace the existing API and generate the URL.
5. The retun value of the URL is a json file which is stored in a dictionary and any specific value can be fetched by passing the key inside the for loop. In my case i have fetched only the price of each product.
